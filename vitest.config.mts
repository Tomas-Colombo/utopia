 * and only on `import.meta.env` — so without this the DB suites see
 * `undefined` and silently skip, which reads exactly like passing.
 *
 * Loaded here in the config module (not `tests/setup.ts`) because that file
 * runs inside the jsdom environment, while workers inherit `process.env` from
 * this process. `.env.local` wins over `.env`, matching how Next.js and
