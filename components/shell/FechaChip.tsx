 * React renders from `getServerSnapshot` to match the server HTML, so without
 * a change notification the chip would keep displaying the SERVER's date
 * forever — the very bug this component exists to avoid. Firing once on mount
 * makes React re-read the browser clock and commit it.
 *
 * The interval is the part the old effect-based version never had: it also
 * rolls the date over at midnight for anyone who leaves a tab open.
